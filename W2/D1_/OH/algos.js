// PROBLEM 1:
// Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.
// Given the scores for a season, determine the number of times Maria breaks her records for most and least points scored during the season.

// Example: [12,24,10,24] would return [1,1]
// Her high and low score was established by the first game in which she scored 12 points 
// The next game she scored 24 points so she broke her high score of 12 
// The next game she scored 10 which broker her low score of 12 
// the final game she scored 24 again this ties her current high score so nothing changes 
// Finally you should return an array with how many times she broke her high and low score she broke both once so you would return [1,1] 




// PROBLEM 2: 
// Reverse an array 
// example reverseArr([1,2,3,4]) would return [4,3,2,1]
// To start you can create a new array adn return that 
// Bonus challenge try to solve the problem without making a second array (working in place)
